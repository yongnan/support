# React UI



- [**Radix UI**](https://www.radix-ui.com/): My favorite. Well tested, accessible, and has one of the best component API-s I’ve seen. It does have some problems when testing it’s components with React Testing Library, and does not support IE very well.
- [**Reach UI**](https://reach.tech/)**:** pretty good and reliable, from the authors of react-router and Remix. Not a lot of components, but covers most use cases.
- [**Headless UI**](https://headlessui.dev/): a small number of components. Well tested, work best with Tailwind CSS. Only drawback is that it’s not that easy to change the functionality and behavior of the components.
- [**Downshift**](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift): By Kent C. Dodds. Focuses on autocomplete, select, combobox, and multi combobox components. Well tested, accessible, and gives you total control over styling **and functionality**. I chose it for our combobox and autocomplete components, and learned a lot from their implementation.
- [**React-aria**](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/): By Adobe. I don’t know too much about it, but it looks interesting.
