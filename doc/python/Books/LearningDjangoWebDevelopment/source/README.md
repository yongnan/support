"This is the repo of the Django Book - Learning Django Web Development"

Django, written in Python, is a web application framework designed to build complex

web applications quickly without any hassle. It loosely follows the MVC pattern and 

adheres to the Don’t Repeat Yourself principle, which makes a database-driven 

application efficient and highly scalable, and is by far the most popular and mature 

Python web framework.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This book is a manual that will help you build a simple yet an effective Django web 

application. It starts by introducing Django, setting it up, and code simple programs. You 

will then learn to build your first Twitter-like app. Later on you will be introduced to 

HashTags, Ajax to enhance the user interface, and tweets. You will then move on to 

create an administration interface, learn database connectivity, and use third-party 

libraries. Then you will learn to debug and deploy Django projects, and also get a 

glimpse of Django with AngularJS and ElasticSearch. By the end of the book you will be 

able to leverage Django framework to develop a fully functional web application with 

minimal efforts.
